The world Heart Federation estimates that over half a billion people around the world are currently living with some or the other form of cardiovascular disease, and this figure is considered to rise further. 
Many researches have been conducted in attempt to pinpoint the most influential factors of heart disease as well as accurately predict the overall risk. 
The early diagnosis of heart disease plays a vital role in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. 
In recent years, the proliferation of data science and machine learning techniques has provided novel avenues for predictive modeling in healthcare. 
Leveraging large-scale datasets encompassing diverse patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and lifestyle factors, machine learning algorithms offer the potential to develop accurate predictive models for identifying individuals at risk of developing CVDs. 
These models not only aid in risk stratification but also facilitate personalized healthcare interventions, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and resource allocation efficiency.
Through the project it is aimed to predict the probability of the patient of having a cardiovascular disorder based on the principles of logistic regression and Recursive Feature Elimination using Cross-Validation (RFECV) and intend to develop a prediction model for early detection of diseases, specifically cardiovascular disorders.
